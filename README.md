# CV_Analyser

CV_Analyser is a Python script and command-line interface for processing images by using OpenCV.

It was originally made for supplementing analysis of interference patterns generated by a modified [Young's Double
Interferometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment "Double-slit experiment - Wikipedia") (the author's high school physics investigatory project).
